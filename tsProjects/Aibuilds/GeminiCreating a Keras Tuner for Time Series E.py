#Creating a Keras Tuner for Time Series Estimation Ensemble
#Understanding the Problem:
#* Input: 16 timesteps, 32 features, 1 channel (likely a grayscale image or a single-channel time series)
#* Output: A single value representing the forex price
#Proposed Model Architecture:
#Given the input shape and the single-output nature of the problem, we'll use a combination of convolutional
# and recurrent layers to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in the time series data.
#Keras Tuner Code:
import keras_tuner as kt
from keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, LSTM, Dense, Flatten
from keras.models import Sequential

def build_model(hp):
    model = Sequential()

    # Convolutional layers to extract features
    model.add(Conv1D(hp.Int('conv_units_1', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32),
                    kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(16, 32, 1)))
    model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))

    # Recurrent layers to capture temporal dependencies
    model.add(LSTM(hp.Int('lstm_units', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32), return_sequences=True))
    model.add(LSTM(hp.Int('lstm_units_2', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32)))

    # Flatten the output from the recurrent layers
    model.add(Flatten())

    # Dense layer for final prediction
    model.add(Dense(1))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    return model

tuner = kt.Hyperband(
    build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_epochs=10,
    factor=3,
    directory='tuner_results',
    project_name='forex_price_prediction'
)

# Assuming you have training and validation data (x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val)
tuner.search(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))

# Best model
best_model = tuner.get_best_models()[0]

"""
Explanation:
* Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input time series using 1D convolutions.
* Recurrent Layers: Capture temporal dependencies using LSTM layers.
* Flatten Layer: Convert the output from the LSTM layers into a 1D vector.
* Dense Layer: Make the final prediction.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Keras Tuner to optimize hyperparameters like the number of units in convolutional and LSTM layers.
Additional Considerations:
* Normalization: Ensure your input data is normalized to a suitable range (e.g., 0-1) for better training stability.
* Ensemble Methods: Consider combining multiple models (e.g., using averaging or stacking) for improved performance.
* Feature Engineering: Explore feature engineering techniques to create additional informative features from the input data.
* Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate evaluation metrics for time series forecasting, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or root mean squared error (RMSE).
By fine-tuning this architecture and hyperparameters using Keras Tuner, you can effectively build a time series estimation ensemble for forex price prediction.
